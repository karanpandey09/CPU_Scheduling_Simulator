# Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JS, Xampp for Login/Register(PHP)

# How to run this project or how to open files....
# Step 1---
Download all the files & images from my repository.
<br>
Make a folder and save all these files & images in one folder.
<br>
Download any animated gif & save in same folder and replace the path of your gif with my gif in the file because the size of my gif was more than 25 mb so I can't upload it.
<br>
Open that folder in your VS Code.

# Step 2---
If you want to run the project, just open "code.html" file and run on live server.
<br>
On interface you can see "Get Started" button, click on it and perform all operations in the project with your input voice or manual typing. Example:- "Open Simulator", "I want to learn algorithms", etc.
<br>
These all the process just for html, css, js without login/register of user.

# Step 3---
If you want to run login/register page, you have to learn Xampp(PHP).
<br>
You can learn it from your college or youtube.
<br>
Open Apache and SQL server in Xampp then you can access Login/Register page properly.

# Note---
You can make login/register page with any alternative method.
<br>
Just simply use the project without login/register that is only for making your project better if you are working in group.

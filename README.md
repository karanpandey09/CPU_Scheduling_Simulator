# Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, JS, Xampp for Login/Register(PHP)

# How to run this project or how to open files....
# Step 1---
Download all the files & images from my repository.
Make a folder and save all these files & images in one folder.
Download any animated gif & save in same folder and replace the path of your gif with my gif in the file because the size of my gif was more than 25 mb so I can't upload it.
Open that folder in your VS Code.

# Step 2---
If you want to run the project, just open "code.html" file and run on live server.
On interface you can see "Get Started" button, click on it and perform all operations in the project with your input voice or manual typing. Example:- "Open Simulator", "I want to learn algorithms", etc.
These all the process just for html, css, js without login/register of user.

# Step 3---
If you want to run login/register page, you have to learn Xampp(PHP).
You can learn it from your college or youtube.
Open Apache and SQL server in Xampp then you can access Login/Register page properly.

# Note---
You can make login/register page with any alternative method.
Just simply use the project without login/register that is only for making your project better if you are working in group.
